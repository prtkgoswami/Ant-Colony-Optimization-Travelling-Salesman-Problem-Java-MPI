# Ant-Colony-Optimization-Travelling-Salesman-Problem-Java-MPI
A project created as the final project for Parallel Programming Class. The two primary concepts are the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) &amp; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). TSP involves traversing all the given cities, passing every city only once. ACO involves creating several agents to solve a problem inspired by real-life Ant Colonies.The project involves solving the Travelling Salesman Problem using using Ant Colony Optimization. Ants will be spawned at each city and will traverse each other city leaving pheromones along the path traversed. With time, the shortest path will have the highest concentration of pheromones. The project has been achieved using Java Message Passing Interface.
